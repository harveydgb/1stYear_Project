    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document a simulator will be built to model the projectile motion of a 'bird', which will be assumed to act as a point like object. This object will start from a randomized height between 0 and 1 units, each unit equals 1 metre, it will then be fired from this point with a specific trajectory relative to the horizontal and a specific velocity at this angle. This motion will then be animated via the use of vPython coding tools before the the 'bird' then either hits the given target, a verticle rectangle, or falls to the ground either side of the target. If this bird does collide with the target, a calculation will then be performed to find out whether the target will be toppled or stay standing. This will be done using physical values for the mass and dimensions of both objects aswell as the velocity and position of the bird at the time of collision.\n",
    "   \n",
    "When either the bird collides with the ground or collides with the target but fails to topple it the game will reset to the initial firing stage where the launch angle and velocity are inputted. This will occur until the bird collides with the target has is calculated to topple it. At each stage whether the bird hits the ground or hits the target and it topples or not, labels will pop up on the screen notifying the player of the outcome of the last attempt. The relevant data for each attempt will be outputted below the game in string format, this is useful to the user as the next inputted values can take this data into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this base structure for the game, more superficial attributes will be added and altered to allo more enjoyable game-play. This will include the animation of the toppling of the tower and better cartoons for the objects within the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will be separated into sections and developed individually before then being linked together. This will hopefully allow for increased efficiency in debugging and finalising each of the features of the simulator. The whole code will be brought together using two overarching while loops, one for whether the bird hits the target, if not the game will reset, and the other for when the bird hits the target it topples or not,  if not the game will reset again. While loops will also be used for all animation purposes of the bird flying and the target toppling. \n",

    "### Physics Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "The physics used treats the bird as a point object for all intensive purposes, this includes collision with the target and the ground as well as its projectile motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "SUVAT formulae have been used to model the flight path of the bird from the target height all the way to where it collides with an object, the vertical and horizontal positions of the bird were calculated at each incrementing time value and the bird's position was updated. As gravity is a constant downwards acceleration the equation, $y = u_y*t + 0.5*(-g)*t^2$ was used, where $u_y$ is the initial vertical compenent of velocity. Horizontal position is rather simple as the horizontal component of velocity does not change and so the equation $x = u_x * t $ is used, where $u_x$ is the horizontal component of velocity. Assumptions made include the bird acting as a point particle in terms of motion and collisions with the ground and the target, it was also assumed that air resistance will have no effect on the bird's motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the bird flies through the air, the components of momentum at each point are also calculated using simple SUVAT equations multiplied by the bird's 'mass'. When the collision occurs the while loop stops and the momentum is no longer updated, it stays at the value just before collision. From this point on if the collision is a 'side_collision' the program will then calculate the torque the bird collision applies on the target, using the equation $ T_a = (p_x/T)*y $ where $T_a$ is the applied torque on the target, $p_x$ is the horizontal momentum and T is the contact time, y being the height of contact from the ground. This value is then compared to the restoring torque due to the Targets own mass, Eq. 7 in Final assignemtn script, and if the applied torque is larger then the target will topple. For collision if there bird enters the Target then the code calculates if the bird is in a small rectangle at the front which would give a side_collision and so a topple calculation, otherwise the bird must have landed on top of the target."

    "The bird could be calculated as an object with a size rather than a point like object, air resistance could also be added to the bird to give a better simulation of the real world. For collsions it would be better to include a better sense checker for if the bird hits the side of the target as currently, if the bird has a horizontal velocity larger than 200m/s the program will potentiall not realise that is has collided with the side of the target and will output at 'Top Collision' instead."
